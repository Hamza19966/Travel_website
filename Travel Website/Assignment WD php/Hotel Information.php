      <p>is a timeless island sanctuary nestled between award winning landscape gardens and the famed Cenang beach, designed based on the concept of Malay “Kampung” or Village.

The 355 rooms housed in 51 individual wooden chalets arranged in a series of clusters with individual verandahs, showcase different themes which vary from swimming pool to landscaped courtyard, lake and seaview. Linked by footpath that wanders with the expansive landscape and palm trees complimented by local plants and shrubs, the resort is a haven for flora and fauna.

The main focus of the lobby building is the prominent roof form which is the adaptation of the traditional “Bumbung Panjang” from the Malay houses found in the state of Kedah, and the richness of the local architecture is further reflected in the elaborate timber decorative panels and floral motifs. The interior of the rooms with dim warm lights give a rustic and original “Kampung” feeling with all the modern amenities that cater to a memorable traditional Malaysian holiday experience.

Discover a world of possibilities in a wide variety of experiences be it leisure and free, vibrant and outdoors, indulgent and rejuvenating, culturally enlightening or meetings with incentives, at Pelangi Beach Resort & Spa, Langkawi.</p>
